Hi!
I am an ecologist with about 15 years of experience spanning ecology, biodiversity assessments, and applied conservation. My research combines field ecology, quantitative analyses, and emerging technologies, such as AI, to address pressing conservation challenges.

I completed my PhD on the ecology of Himalayan wolf at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), where I studied the food preferences, dietary competition, human conflict and distribution drivers of one of the least-studied large carnivores in Asia. Earlier, I earned a Master's degree in Wildlife Science, where I explored the relationship between the morphology and biodiversity of caves in central India. 

Professionally, I began with the Wildlife Trust of India in 2009, contributing to assessments of potential habitats for cheetah reintroduction in India. At WII, I have since worked on long-term carnivore research, biodiversity surveys, and large-scale conservation application projects. These include biodiversity assessments in Himachal Pradesh and road ecology projects in Maharashtra, where my role involved identifying wildlife crossing hotspots and designing mitigation measures for high-speed infrastructure corridors.

Alongside field-based conservation, I formed a collaboration between WII and Microsoft’s AI for Earth program, for development and evaluation of [MegaDetector ver. 4](https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector){:target="_blank"}, which automatically segregates animal images in camera trap datasets. Building on this, I led the development of [SpSeg (Species Segregator)](/pages/SpSeg/){:target="_blank"}, a machine learning tool for species-level classification of Central Indian wildlife, achieving 89% accuracy.

Currently, I serve as Assistant Managing Editor of the Journal of Wildlife Science (JWLS), where I overlook the peer-review process, ensuring the publication and dissemination of rigourough science with maintaining high ethical and scientific standards. Alongside editorial responsibilities, I continue collaborating on ecology and conservation research and application. My core expertise lies in ecological modelling, data analyses, and AI-assisted workflows for big data. Broadly, I am motivated by strengthening science-backed, technology-enabled conservation practices, and furthering ecological knowledge with scientific temper.
