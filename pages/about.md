Hi!
My name is Shivam Shrotriya, and I am an ecologist with about 13 years of experience in conservation and ecology research. I am particularly passionate about the use of modern technology, such as AI, in conservation efforts and have extensive experience in data analyses and ecological modelling.

I hold a PhD on the ecology of Himalayan wolves, where I studied its feeding patterns, prey distribution and availability, dietary competition, human conflict and wolf distribution drivers. Before that, I received my Master's degree in Wildlife Science, where I studied the relationship between the morphology and biodiversity of caves. After my Master's degree, I was briefly associated with the field research team assessing potential habitats for the reintroduction of cheetahs in India. I worked at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) for the "Ecology and Conservation of the Himalayan Wolf" project from 2010 to 2018. For a short while in 2018, I also participated in a biodiversity survey in four protected areas of Himachal Pradesh.

Later, I also had the opportunity to work on a conservation-focused road ecology project in Maharashtra, India from 2018 to 2022. The project aimed to provide wildlife connectivity on a newly developing high-speed roadway connecting two major cities. In this role, I provided ecological input by assessing the impacts of the road, identifying wildlife crossing hotspots, and designing mitigation plans and structures.

In addition to these projects, I helped WII to collaborated with Microsoft on the development of AI tools for conservation research. Microsoft's "MegaDetector" automatically segregates animal images in camera trap datasets. I led the development of a machine learning AI tool called ["SpSeg"](/pages/SpSeg/){:target="_blank"} for species-level classification of animal images tagged by "MegaDetector". I also generated a grant for WII from Microsoft's "AI for Earth" program to develop "SpSeg". At the moment, the tool is trained for the Central Indian landscape and has achieved 89% accuracy in species-level classification.

Currently, I am working as a Project Scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India, where I am helping to implement wildlife mitigation measures on an industrial infrastructure development.
