# What is SpSeg?
'SpSeg' (short for 'Species Segregator) is a Machine-learning tool for species-level segregation of camera-trap images originating from wildlife census and
studies. SpSeg is currently trained specifically for the Central Indian landscape .

>SpSeg is part of Microsoft's [MegaDetector](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/master/megadetector.md "MegaDetector"){:target="_blank"} ecosystem and works as a second-step to species level segregation of camera-trap images. The approach in MegaDetector pipeline is to first classify the images into **Animal**, **Person**, **Vehicle** and **Blank**, followed by a fine level classification of **Animal** images into useful taxonomic classes.
